                            This Berlin-based brand began in 2012 with Max von Senger, a product design student and bike
                            messenger passionate about cycling's balance between effort and exhilaration. Inspired by
                            the
                            aesthetics of bicycles and elements of culture, fashion, and streetwear, Max built his first
                            bike while at Universität der Künste.

                        <p>
                            Deciding on a name for the brand came from common slang within Max’s circle of friends.
                            “‘Standert’ was something we said all the time, for everything,” he explains. “We used it as
                            a way to say ‘of course’ or ‘why even ask?’ Especially with that pronunciation of ‘-ert’ at
                            the end.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On 21 July 2012, Standert opened its doors onto Invalidenstr., the Mitte location that
                            served as both retail space and company headquarters for the next seven years. “Early on, it
                            was all about the café,” Max recalls. “Cycle cafés were a new concept, and we wanted to
                            create a space for people to hang out.”

                        <p>
                            By 2019, Standert was bursting at the seams. Still run by a small team, many of whom had
                            been there since the beginning—and still in the original space on Invalidenstr. —Standert’s
                            brand recognition and its bicycles had outpaced the growth and maturity of the company
                            behind it. A decision had to be made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Soon after, Standert moved headquarters from the café’s crampedbasement to a newly erected
                            building on Friedrichstr., with aspacious ground-floor showroom that reflected the ambitions
                            of theup-and-coming brand. The Standert Cycling Hub currently functionsas a meeting point
                            for the weekly Feierabendrunde rides, as well asthe sole location where one can see the full
                            collection of Standertmodels in person.

                            A decade of organic growth and community building proved to be a winning combination for
                            this now globally recognized bike brand. As Standert embarks on yet another new chapter in
                            the company’s history, Max and Anna von Senger look to the future with confidence.“Let’s
                            make the bike community a friendly and welcoming one,” they request, “In the spirit of what
                            we think is the way forward for cycling.”
